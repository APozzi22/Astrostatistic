    "1. Read in solutions/transient.npy. This is a (100 x 3) numpy array, containing some time-series measurements from a transient phenomenon. The first column is time (arbitrary units), the second column is the flux (arbitrary units), and the third column are homoescedastic measurement uncertainties on the flux. Plot this data with the uncertainties.\n",

    "3. Using one of the MCMC sampler that we looked at in class (emcee, pymc), perform a Bayesian analysis that recovers an MCMC chain of posterior probability samples for the joint parameter space of ${b, \\ A, \\ t_0, \\ \\alpha}$. You must decide on how many samples are appropriate for running your MCMC. For your priors, make them $b \\in Uniform[0, 50]$, $A \\in Uniform[0, 50]$, $t_0 \\in Uniform[0, 100]$, and $ln(\\alpha) \\in Uniform[-5, 5]$ (careful: uniform in $ln(\\alpha)$, not $\\alpha$).\n",

    "5. Make a corner plot of the 4-D parameter space, with labels, $[68, 95] %$ credible levels and quantiles, and titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now choose 100 samples randomly from your burned, thinned chain and plot the 100 corresponding burst time-series on a figure along with the original data. You may want to choose a transparency for these 100 burst curves that allows you to see everything nicely. These are showing the posterior spread of model solutions that are consistent with the data.\n",

    "7. For each parameter, find the median and 90% credible region of the marginalized distribution and quote results as, for instance, $t_0 = X_{-Z}^{+Y}$\n"
