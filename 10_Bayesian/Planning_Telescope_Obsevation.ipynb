    "You are a real astronomer (not a theory guy like me) and are planning an expensive observational campaign. You want to know how likely it is that tomorrow night will be clear given the weather tonight (clear or cloudy). The key piece of information here is that the weather tomorrow depends on the weather today. From past history, you know that:\n",
