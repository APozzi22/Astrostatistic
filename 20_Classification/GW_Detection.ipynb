    "All experiments have selection effects. Some sources are easier to detect than others which distorts the population of sources we observe (this crucial in astronomy! Surveys are typically flux limited). In order to decided if a feature in the observed population of objects is telling us something new about reality, we need to understand and model our selection effects (for instance: it would be wrong to say that all stars are close by just because we can't observe those that are very far!). In observational astronomy, this is known as Malmquist bias and was first formulated in 1922.\n",

    "This dataset contains simulated gravitational-wave signals from merging black holes (careful the file size is >1 GB). If you've never seen them, the .h5 format is a highly optimized storage strategy for large datasets. It's amazing. In python, you can read it with h5py.\n",

    "- ra, dec: the location of the source in the sky\n",
    "- iota: the inclination of the orbital plane'\n",

    "The detectability is defined using the snr (signal-to-noise ratio) computed with a state-of-the-art model of the LIGO/Virgo detector network. Some (many?) of you will have studied this in the gravitational-wave class; see here for a nice write-up. All you need to know now is that we threshold the snr values and assume that LIGO will (not) see a source if snr>12 (snr<12). The resulting 0-1 labels are reported in the det attribute in the dataset.\n",
